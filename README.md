# Resident Evil 4 Mute In-Game Music and Ashley Special 2 Costume Steps
This mod allow you to mute In-Game Music, and Ashley "clank" or step sound for her Special 2 Costume.
The reason I make this Github repo is that I can't find these modifications on the internet, and I want to back this up to my git so I can easily find it and easily just share it globally. Found some on Steam Community but most of them lead to dead end (broken link or such)

# How To use
Clone this repo and copy the content to ...\steamapps\common\Resident Evil 4

Or just download this repo as ZIP (assuming you don't know how to use ```git``` CLI)

# Additional
You can either delete one of the 2 files inside the folder if you want only to remove one thing
1. pl18.xwb ==> For Armour steps
2. bio4bgm ==> For In-Game music

# Issues
- Will not mute Ashley's step when playing as Ashley
- Nothing

tested in 1.1.0
