# Resident Evil 4 Mute In-Game Music and Ashley Special 2 Costume Steps
This mod allow you to mute In-Game Music, and Ashley "clank" or step sound for her Special 2 Costume.
The reason I make this Github repo is that I can't find these modifications on the internet, and I want to back this up to my git so I can easily find it and easily just share it globally. Found some on Steam Community but most of them lead to dead end (broken link or such)

# How To use
**Step1**
<br>Rename "bio4bgm NO BGM.xwb" to "bio4bgm.xwb" 
And "pl18 NO ARMOR.xwb" to "pl18.xwb"

**Step 2**
<br>**(Mute In-Game Music)** Replace the "bio4bgm.xwb" in "\Resident Evil 4\BIO4\snd"
<br>**(Mute Ashley Special 2 Costume Steps)** Replace "pl18.xwb" in "\Resident Evil 4\BIO4\snd"
